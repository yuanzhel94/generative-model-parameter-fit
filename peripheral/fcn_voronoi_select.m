function xnew = fcn_voronoi_select(x,e,ndraw,xbounds,ybounds,pow)
% preferentially sample parameter values using voronoi tessellation
%   Function derived from Betzel et al (2016).
%
% Inputs:
%
%   x = [P x 2] set of parameter values (the eta and gamma from the paper).
%   e = [P x 1] set of energies (we treat small values as indicative of
%       "better" samples).
%
%   ndraw = number of new samples you want to generate.
%
%   xbounds = range of eta parameters (the bounds in which any interesting
%       behavior will occur -- can be really broad).
%
%   ybounds = same as above, but for gamma parameters.
%
%   pow = the "alpha" exponent from the paper. If this value is big, then
%       your new samples will be drawn from only the best regions of
%       parameter space. Smaller values will still preferentially sample
%       from good regions of parameter space, but may include some
%       not-so-great samples, as well.
%
% Outputs:
%
%   xnew = [ndraw x 2] set of parameters.
%

% we map parameters to the interval [0,1] because there can
% be huge differences of scale (eta tends to be approx an order of
% magnitude greater than gamma parameters for many models)
